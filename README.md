# mini-tube 
:baby::baby::baby::baby:

Mini youtube with instant search and play. My attempt to make something similar to http://ytinstant.com/.
It uses youtube api to search for 5 videos at a time ordered by "relevance" and plays the first one as soon as the GET request is complete.

##  demo :open_mouth:
